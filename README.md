## Project summary
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

## Project contents

run_analysis.R contains the code to execute all of the steps listed in project summary.
CodeBook.md contains further information about the data and transformations.
